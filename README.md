# Python OOP Concepts with Examples

This repository is a complete guide to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, with simple and clear examples for each concept. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your OOP skills, this repo provides practical and well-structured demonstrations of core principles.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Objects**  
  Learn how to create and use objects in Python. Examples cover class definition, object instantiation, and accessing attributes and methods.

- **Methods**  
  Understand instance methods, class methods, and static methods, along with their appropriate use cases.

- **Decorators**  
  Explore decorators within classes, such as `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and custom decorators in an OOP context.

- **Inheritance**  
  Demonstrates single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, and the use of `super()`.

- **Encapsulation**  
  Covers access modifiers (`public`, `_protected`, `__private`) and how to use getters and setters.

- **Abstraction**  
  Implements abstract classes and methods using Python’s `abc` module to enforce design rules.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Showcases method overriding and duck typing to achieve polymorphic behavior.

- **Bing Game**  
  A mini project that combines all the above OOP principles into a fun and interactive game example.
